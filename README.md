# Hotel Project using SQL, Excel & BI tools 

## Introduction
In this project I will use MySQL to explore and analyze data and then visualize the data in Tableau to provide insights to the stakeholders.

## Objective
As a data analyst hired by the hotel company to enhance their hotel businesses, my primary focus is to compare their City Hotels with their Resort Hotels. The stakeholders are relying on data-driven insights from me to make informed decisions. Here are some of the questions I will answer:

1. Is hotel revenue growing by year? 
2. Should the hotel increase parking size?
3. What trends can see see with the data?
4. How did COVID affect the hotel business?
